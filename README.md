# UFO's
## Overview of Project
  Goal of the project is to create an interactive webpage that will allow users to filter through UFO sightings by multiple criterea.
## Results. 
  The completed website allows users to narrow a UFO search by either date, city, state or shape. All sightings included are from the United States. The site allows users to isolate results by shape if someone had a specific interest. Same could be done for any of the other filter options.
## Summary
  This website is a solid start for people with interest in UFO's. One major drawback of the site is that it does not include data from outside of the US. Adding foreign data will make the site more useful and increase traffic. Another recomondation would be to have a map option that would allow users to see sightings in a map view. Another option may be to allow people to submit their own UFO sightings.
